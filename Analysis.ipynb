By altering one input at a time—whether a cash transfer framed as a loss, a growth-mindset text, a diagnostic feedback dashboard, or a same-gender role model—these experiments shift beliefs, effort, or resource allocation just enough to raise achievement, often at scale and for pennies per student. Effects are largest when the tweak (a) directly relaxes a binding constraint (e.g., vision correction, remedial tutoring), (b) leverages behavioral biases (loss aversion, social norms, peer pressure), or (c) is mediated by an influential actor (teacher, parent, mentor) whose own behavior changes first.\n",

            "• Fade-out vs persistence: cognitive gains often fade unless reinforced by complementary inputs; socio-emotional or institutional changes (school management, aspirations) show longer shadows.  \n",
            "• Scalability cliffs: pilots succeed, but large-scale roll-outs (nationwide SMS campaigns, Danish parent reading programs) lose potency without fidelity or targeting.  \n",

            "THEORY OF CHANGE: Labor markets are thick with frictions—information gaps, search costs, discrimination, and mismatched expectations—that keep workers and good jobs apart. By randomizing light-touch changes (a résumé line, a wage subsidy, a training voucher, a flexible schedule, an online tip, a referral nudge) researchers trace how each friction operates and which levers most cheaply unlock productive matches. The generic pathway is: (1) identify a specific friction, (2) introduce a targeted micro-intervention, (3) observe shifts in application, hiring, retention, or earnings, and (4) scale or discard the lever based on cost-effectiveness.\n",

            "ONE-LINE SUMMARY: RCTs test small, low-cost behavioral interventions—information, reminders, incentives, social cues—to shift health-related choices and outcomes.\n",
            "THEORY OF CHANGE: Health decisions are shaped more by attention, salience, social norms, and small frictions than by price or knowledge alone. By redesigning how information is framed, when it arrives, who delivers it, and what small rewards or nudges accompany it, programs can change beliefs, reduce hassle costs, and trigger pro-health actions that accumulate into better individual and population-level outcomes without large new infrastructure or clinical services.\n",
            "KEY PATTERNS: (1) Modality dominance: SMS, postal letters, radio, WhatsApp, in-person scripts—short, timely, repetitive messaging is everywhere. (2) Incentive size is often tiny (≤US$5–$20) yet still effective for vaccination, screening, adherence. (3) Non-financial motivators—public recognition, social comparison, commitment contracts—work as well as or better than cash for providers and some patients. (4) Peer and social-network effects repeatedly amplify impacts: bring-a-friend vouchers, peer shaming of providers, social-contact deworming spillovers. (5) One-time or short-duration treatments generate lasting effects when they create new habits or social norms (e.g., cooker-retention in Ethiopia, insurance renewal in Ghana). (6) Heterogeneity by gender, bargaining power, trust, and baseline knowledge is reported in nearly every paper, reinforcing that tailoring and targeting matter. (7) Supply-side behavioral levers (provider pay-for-performance, monitoring, non-financial awards) improve service quality without crowding out intrinsically motivated tasks.\n",
            "DIVERSITY NOTE: Three large sub-clusters coexist: (a) patient-level nudges—reminders, subsidies, risk messages, commitment devices; (b) provider-level nudges—PBF, social recognition, audit shaming, training; and (c) community/social accountability interventions—scorecards, participatory forums, school or child-led monitoring.\n",
